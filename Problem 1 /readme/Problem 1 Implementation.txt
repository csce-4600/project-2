Problem 1 Implementation 
========================

1. Program generates required amount of processes and initializes each process with random memory and cycle requirements (uses normal distribution for randomization)

2. simulateProcess function simulates the arrival of processes in the queue with incremental cycle counts.

3. When each process simulates the execution, the program uses malloc() call to allocate memory required.

4. It also uses usleep function to simulate program execution time. Note usleep(1000) = 1 milisecond. And its multiplied by the number of cycles in each process.

5. Prints out the execution time for allocation/deallocation at the end of each process execution.

6. At the end of process execution the program will display the total time it took to execute all processes.
